## Rules
(more details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)))
1. Objective: Combine tiles to reach the 2048 tile.

2. Gameplay:

    Use arrow keys (or swipe) to move tiles on a 4x4 grid.
    When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one with their sum.

3. Tiles:

    Every move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in an empty spot on the board.

4. Winning: The game is won when a tile with the value 2048 appears on the board.

5. Losing: The game ends when no more moves are possible (no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same value).
